  abstract = {Weather forecasting has become an important field of research in the last few decades. In most of the cases the researcher had attempted to establish a linear relationship between the input weather data and the corresponding target data. But with the discovery of nonlinearity in the nature of weather data, the focus has shifted towards the nonlinear prediction of the weather data. Although, there are many literatures in nonlinear statistics for the weather forecasting, most of them required that the nonlinear model be specified before the estimation is done. But since the weather data is nonlinear and follows a very irregular trend, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has evolved out to be a better technique to bring out the structural relationship between the various entities. The paper examines the applicability of ANN approach by developing effective and reliable nonlinear predictive models for weather analysis also compare and evaluate the performance of the developed models using different transfer functions, hidden layers and neurons to forecast maximum, temperature for 365 days of the year.},

  abstract = {With the increased usage of digital cameras and picture clicking devices, the number of digital images increases rapidly, which in return demand for image quality assessment in terms of blur. Based on the edge type and sharpness analysis using Laplacian operator, an effective representation of blur image detection scheme is proposed in this paper, which can determine that whether the image is blurred or not, and what is the extent of blur through Variance of Laplacian. In this project a simple, reliable and fast algorithm for image noise estimation is presented. Images taken for the testing is assumed to be corrupted by additive zero mean Gaussian noise. To exclude structures or details from contributive to the noise variance estimation, an easy edge detection algorithm inculcating first-order gradients is applied first. Then a Laplacian operator followed by an averaging over the whole image will provide very accurate noise variance estimation. There is only one parameter which is self-determined and adaptive to the image contents. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs well for different types of images over a large range of noise variances. Performance comparisons against alternative approaches are also provided. Results obtain through screenshots of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {Thermography is an entirely non-invasive and non-contact imaging technique that is widely used in the medicinal field. Since the early detection of cancer is very important, the computer-aided system can increase the rate of diagnosis, cure, and survival of the affected person. Considering the high cost of treatment in addition to the high prevalence of affected persons, early diagnosis is the most important step in reducing the health and social complications of this disease. Currently, mammography is the main method used for screening breast cancer. However, for young woman, mammography is not recommended due to the low contrast that results from the dense breast, and alternative techniques must be considered for this purpose. Breast cancer is the main cause of cancer-related mortality among women. Early detection of cancer-especially breast cancer-will aid the treatment process. Our goal is to develop software for detecting breast cancer automatically that uses image-processing techniques and algorithms to analyze thermal breast images to detect the signs of the disease in these images, allowing the early detection of breast cancer. A new algorithm is proposed for the extraction of the breast characteristic features based on bio-data, image analysis, and image statistics. These features have been extracted from the thermal images captured by a thermal camera, and will be used to classify the breast images as normal or suspected by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) optimized by Bayes algorithm. By using our proposed algorithm, a 98.95\% of accuracy rate was obtained for the thermal images in the dataset belonging to 140 individuals.},

  abstract = {Changes in insect biomass, abundance, and diversity are challenging to track at sufficient spatial, temporal, and taxonomic resolution. Camera traps can capture habitus images of ground-dwelling insects. However, currently sampling involves manually detecting and identifying specimens. Here, we test whether a convolutional neural network (CNN) can classify habitus images of ground beetles to species level, and estimate how correct classification relates to body size, number of species inside genera, and species identity. We created an image database of 65,841 museum specimens comprising 361 carabid beetle species from the British Isles and fine-tuned the parameters of a pretrained CNN from a training dataset. By summing up class confidence values within genus, tribe, and subfamily and setting a confidence threshold, we trade-off between classification accuracy, precision, and recall and taxonomic resolution. The CNN classified 51.9\% of 19,164 test images correctly to species level and 74.9\% to genus level. Average classification recall on species level was 50.7\%. Applying a threshold of 0.5 increased the average classification recall to 74.6\% at the expense of taxonomic resolution. Higher top value from the output layer and larger sized species were more often classified correctly, as were images of species in genera with few species. Fine-tuning enabled us to classify images with a high mean recall for the whole test dataset to species or higher taxonomic levels, however, with high variability. This indicates that some species are more difficult to identify because of properties such as their body size or the number of related species. Together, species-level image classification of arthropods from museum collections and ecological monitoring can substantially increase the amount of occurrence data that can feasibly be collected. These tools thus provide new opportunities in understanding and predicting ecological responses to environmental change.},

Machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks are already transforming many technological fields and have also proven successful in gravitational-wave astrophysics for detection and characterization of gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes [5], [6], [7]. Here we use a deep-learning approach to rapidly identify transient gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star mergers in noisy time series representative of typical gravitational-wave detector data. Specifically, we show that a deep convolution neural network trained on 100,000 data samples can promptly identify binary neutron star gravitational-wave signals and distinguish them from noise and signals from merging black hole binaries. These results demonstrate the potential of artificial neural networks for real-time detection of gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star mergers, which is critical for a prompt follow-up and detailed observation of the electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts accompanying these important transients.},

  abstract = {The complexity of an image tells many aspects of the image content and is an important factor in the selection of source material for testing various image processing methods. We explore objective measures of complexity that are based on compression. We show that spatial information (SI) measures strongly correlate with compression-based complexity measures. Among the commonly used SI measures, the mean of the edge magnitude is shown to be the best predictor. Moreover, we find that compression-based complexity of an image normally increases with decreasing resolution.},

  abstract = {We propose a complexity measure for black-and-white (B/W) digital images, based on the detection of typical length scales in the depicted motifs. Complexity is associated with diversity in those length scales. In this sense, the proposed measure penalizes images where typical scales are limited to small lengths, of a few pixels –as in an image where gray levels are distributed at random– or to lengths similar to the image size –as when gray levels are ordered into a simple, broad pattern. We introduce a complexity index which captures the structural richness of images with a wide range of typical scales, and compare several images with each other on the basis of this index. Since the index provides an objective quantification of image complexity, it could be used as the counterpart of subjective visual complexity in experimental perception research. As an application of the complexity index, we build a “complexity map” for South-American topography, by analyzing a large B/W image that represents terrain elevation data in the continent. Results show that the complexity index is able to clearly reveal regions with intricate topographical features such as river drainage networks and fjord-like coasts. Although, for the sake of concreteness, our complexity measure is introduced for B/W images, the definition can be straightforwardly extended to any object that admits a mathematical representation as a function of one or more variables. Thus, the quantification of structural richness can be adapted to time signals and distributions of various kinds.},
